## Full Description

**Glitch Desktop Effect** is a Windows application that creates dynamic real-time glitch effects across your entire desktop. Based on the code provided, here is the complete description and its main features:

### How It Works (Technical)

1. **Screen Capture:**

   * Captures the entire desktop screenshot every 30ms using WinAPI.
   * Stores the image in 32-bit bitmap format in memory.

2. **Glitch Manipulation:**

   * Randomly selects 20 horizontal lines to manipulate.
   * Shifts lines horizontally with random intensity (up to 50 pixels).
   * Fills empty areas with black for a *digital corruption* effect.
   * Uses a backup buffer to preserve the original image.

3. **Rendering:**

   * Displays the glitch result as a transparent overlay on top of the desktop.
   * Uses layered window technique (`WS_EX_LAYERED`) for transparency.
   * Window is topmost (`WS_EX_TOPMOST`) without interfering with user interactions.
   * Visual updates every 30ms for smooth animation.
